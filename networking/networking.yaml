- What is OSI Model:
  - 7 Layers each describe a specific networking component
  - Layer 7 -> Application - HTTP / FTP / gRPC / Microsoft office
               -> Post request with JSON data to HTTPS server (Sender)

  - Layer 6 -> Presentation - Encoding, Serialization ( json from layer 7 to string )
               -> Serialize JSON to flat byte strings (Sender)

  - Layer 5 -> Session - Connection establishment, TLS
               -> Request to establish TCP connection / TLS (Sender)

  - Layer 4 -> Transport - UDP / TCP (segments)
               -> Sends SYN request target port 443 (Sender)

  - Layer 3 -> Network - IP (packets)
               -> SYN is placed an IP packet(s) and adds the source/dest IPs (Sender)

  - Layer 2 -> Data link - Frames, Mac address Ethernet
               -> Each packet goes into a single frame and adds the source/dest MAC addresses (Sender)

  - Layer 1 -> Physical - Electric signals, fiber, radio waves
               -> Each frame becomes string of bits which converted into either a raido signal(wifi), electric signal (Sender)
    
- The shortcoming of the OSI model:
  - OSI model has too many layers which can be hard to comprehend
  - Hard to argue about which layer does What
  - Simple to deal with layers 5-6-7 as just one layer, Application
  - TCP/IP model does just that
